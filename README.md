The aim of the project is a create ChatApp with ASP.NetCore6 and SignalR. 
# Description
* Client;    
  * The client front end was built with HTML/CSS. Wrote functions with Javascript, provided the connection between the Server and the client with these functions, and performed the functions that the user would perform in the frontend in the background. 
  * Users who want to chat can log in, send a message to any online user, create a room, and send a joint message to the users in the room. Can also receive messages from other users.        
* Server;
  * The server backend was written with .NET and SignalR. We also made functions such as ensuring message communication dynamism between clients, creating rooms, and sending messages asynchronously to users in rooms functional on the server side.
